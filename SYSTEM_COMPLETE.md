### Mode 2: Coordinated Task (Philippa Orchestrates)
**You:**
```
@Lady Philippa build me a landing page
```

**Philippa:**
```
Your Majesty, okay bet landing page - let me coordinate the court 📋

ASSIGNMENTS:
- @Lady Genevieve - UX design
- @Lord Sebastian - Technical build
- @Lady Arabella - Marketing copy

Does this work? Reply 'proceed' fr fr 🎯
```

**You:**
```
proceed
```

**Philippa creates thread, courtiers discuss:**

**Sebastian:** "@Lady Genevieve should we use a modal or dedicated page?"

**Genevieve:** "@Lord Sebastian dedicated page hits different, better UX"

**Sebastian:** "@Lady Genevieve okay you ate with that, dedicated page it is"

**Arabella:** "@Lady Genevieve @Lord Sebastian for copy, should the CTA be above or below the features?"

**Genevieve:** "@Lady Arabella above AND below - users need it immediately but also after they're convinced"

**Philippa synthesizes:**
```
📋 FINAL REPORT TO HIS MAJESTY 📋

Landing page complete!

DELIVERABLES:
✅ UX Design (Genny) - Dedicated page, CTA above & below
✅ Code (Seb) - Next.js, deployed to Vercel
✅ Copy (Bella) - Compelling headlines and CTAs

STATUS: Complete, Your Majesty 🚀
```

**Result:** You gave one command, watched the team collaborate, got a complete deliverable.

### Mode 3: Court Debate (Strategic Decision)
**You:**
```
!summon Should we add social features?
```

**Courtiers debate in thread:**

**Alistair:** "strategically this is risky, social is a distraction from core value"

**Arabella:** "@Lord Alistair but social features = viral growth potential"

**Sebastian:** "@Lady Arabella technically social adds 3 months of dev time"

**Genevieve:** "@Lord Sebastian and users don't need social, they need the core product to work better"

**Beatrice:** "@Lady Genevieve facts, let's invest in core features not social"

**Philippa synthesizes:**
```
Consensus: Don't add social features yet. Focus on core product first. Revisit in 6 months if we have traction.
```

**Result:** You see the debate, they reach consensus, you make final call.

## The Team Dynamics

### How Courtiers Talk to Each Other:

**To the King (You):**
- "Your Majesty" — formal address
- Maximum respect
- Present final recommendations

**To Each Other:**
- "yo Seb" / "okay Bella" / "aight Genny" — casual nicknames
- Gen Z group chat energy
- Natural collaboration
- Friendly debates

**Example:**

**To You:**
> "Your Majesty, the landing page is complete. Your Majesty ate with this product idea fr 🚀"

**To Each Other:**
> "yo Seb, should we use a modal? @Lady Genevieve thoughts?"

### The Vibe:

It's like having a **Gen Z team working for you**. They:
- Respect you as the King
- Collaborate with each other as peers
- Discuss things naturally
- Reach consensus together
- Report back to you with results

## Your Role as King

### What You Do:
1. **Set the vision** — "I want to build X"
2. **Give high-level tasks** — "@Lady Philippa make this happen"
3. **Watch discussions** — See courtiers collaborate
4. **Make final decisions** — Approve plans, choose options
5. **Give next task** — Keep the momentum going

### What You DON'T Do:
- ❌ Micromanage each courtier
- ❌ Relay messages between courtiers
- ❌ Figure out implementation details
- ❌ Coordinate timelines yourself
- ❌ Synthesize their work

**Philippa and the courtiers handle all of that!**
