# 📋 Phase-Based Coordination (NO MORE CHAOS!)

## The Problem (SOLVED ✅)

**Before:** Everyone talks at once → conversation spirals → chaos → can't track progress

**Now:** Structured phases → one phase at a time → organized → clear progress

---

## How It Works

### The New System:

1. **Philippa breaks work into phases** (e.g., Research → Design → Build)
2. **Only Phase 1 courtiers can respond** (others are blocked)
3. **When Phase 1 is done, Philippa synthesizes**
4. **You approve → Phase 2 starts**
5. **Repeat until complete**

**Result:** Clean, organized, no chaos! 🎯

---

## Example Workflow

### Step 1: You Ask Philippa

**You:**
```
@Lady Philippa, Grand Vizier I want to build a financial tracker
```

### Step 2: Philippa Creates Phased Plan

**Philippa:**
```
Your Majesty, okay bet financial tracker - let me break this into organized phases 📋

PHASE 1: Research & Requirements
- Lord Alistair: Analyze trading strategies and define core requirements
- Lord Edmund: Research competitor financial trackers and market trends
Deliverables: Requirements doc, competitive analysis

PHASE 2: Design & Architecture
- Lord Sebastian: Design technical architecture and choose tech stack
- Lady Genevieve: Create UX wireframes and user flow
Deliverables: System architecture, UI mockups

PHASE 3: Execution & Launch
- Lady Beatrice: Calculate costs and create pricing strategy
- Lady Arabella: Craft marketing messaging and launch plan
Deliverables: Budget breakdown, GTM strategy

PLAN:
1. Phase 1 courtiers respond first
2. I synthesize their work
3. You approve → we move to Phase 2
4. Repeat until complete

This keeps things organized - no chaos, one phase at a time fr fr 🎯

Does this work Your Majesty? Reply 'proceed' and I'll start Phase 1!
```

### Step 3: You Approve

**You:**
```
proceed
```

### Step 4: System Starts Phase 1

### Step 5: Phase 1 Courtiers Respond

**Lord Alistair:**
```
Your Majesty, okay so for trading strategies and requirements 🧠

CORE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Portfolio tracking (multiple stocks)
2. Real-time price updates
3. Price alerts (high/low thresholds)
4. Performance analytics (gains/losses)
5. Historical charts
6. Mobile access

PRIORITY FEATURES (MVP):
✅ Add/remove stocks
✅ View current prices

**Lord Edmund:**
```
Your Majesty, okay so I searched competitor trackers 🔍

COMPETITORS:

2. Yahoo Finance - free, comprehensive, dated UI
3. Personal Capital - free, wealth management focus
4. Mint - free, budgeting + investing
5. Kubera - paid ($150/yr), crypto + stocks

MARKET TRENDS:
