## Top Insights

### From Nan Yu
*Nan Yu*

> "If you look at people who are at the pinnacle of their craft, you can basically tell how good the output is going to be of their work product by how fast they're going. If they're going really fast, and they're obviously not being sloppy and then leaving a mess all over the place, it's like, 'Yeah...."

**Key insight:** High speed is often a signal of high competence and craft rather than sloppiness.

**Apply this by:**
- Index on competence and expertise rather than rushing to achieve speed.
- Use high speed to increase the number of iterations and variations you can test.

### From Dylan Field

> "Get it out as fast as you possibly can. Everything they tell you about making sure that you get a product out really quickly is totally true. The faster you get it out, the more feedback you get. That is a positive thing. And now I index on that when we try to build."

**Key insight:** Prioritize shipping speed to accelerate the feedback loop, which is the most valuable asset in early product development.

**Apply this by:**
- Index on speed to market to gather real-world feedback earlier
- Use internal champions to catalyze the team to close the 'gap' and ship

### From Matt MacInnis
*Matt MacInnis*

> "We have a product quality list, which we lovingly at Rippling call the PQL... it articulates in the simplest ways the standards we want you to meet when you ship a product. It doesn't apply to every product, not every line applies to every product, but it's comprehensive and it provides me with a..."

**Key insight:** A standardized 'Product Quality List' (PQL) acts as a factory inspection to ensure consistent shipping standards.

**Apply this by:**
- Create a 'PQL' checklist of quality standards that must be met before any release.
- Iterate on the checklist every time a bug or failure slips through to production.

### From Nick Turley
*Nick Turley*

> "I just really want to jump to the punchline of like, 'Okay, why can't we do this now?' or, 'Why can't we do it tomorrow?' ... if this was the most important thing and you wanted to truly maximally accelerate it, what would you do? That doesn't mean that you go do that, but it's really a good..."

**Key insight:** The 'maximally accelerated' principle acts as a forcing function to strip away non-essential blockers and identify the critical path.

**Apply this by:**
- Ask 'What would it take to ship this tomorrow?' to uncover hidden dependencies
- Separate high-velocity product development from rigorous, slower safety processes

### From Nicole Forsgren
*Nicole Forsgren*

> "Speed and stability move together. Most people only think about this from the speed standpoint, which means when you move faster, you are more stable, which means you're pushing smaller changes more often, right. Because if you're pushing all the time, it's going to be very, very small changes,..."

**Key insight:** Contrary to common belief, increasing shipping speed actually improves system stability by reducing the size and complexity of each change.

**Apply this by:**
- Push smaller changes more frequently to reduce the 'blast radius' of potential failures.
- Aim for on-demand deployment to ensure that when errors occur, they are easier to debug and mitigate.
