## Top Insights

### From Jess Lachs

> "Retention is a terrible thing to goal on. It's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output."

**Key insight:** Avoid using lagging indicators like retention as primary goals; instead, identify and move the short-term input metrics that predict them.

**Apply this by:**
- Identify proxy metrics that are sensitive to experimentation and correlate with long-term goals.
- Focus on inputs that the team can realistically influence within a quarterly or monthly timeframe.

> "Everything at LinkedIn is a very connected ecosystem... how you make decisions based on the very complicated ecosystem is actually not very difficult because we're all here to help people connect to economic opportunity. Every time there's a discussion... everyone knows how that decision is going..."

**Key insight:** A clear, high-level North Star simplifies decision-making across complex, interconnected product ecosystems.

**Apply this by:**
- Establish a singular, company-wide mission that serves as the ultimate tie-breaker for product decisions

### From Jeff Weinstein

> "What was the value that we're trying to produce for the customer and can we measure it from their perspective? ... We suggested this metric to ourselves, companies that have no support tickets through the incorporation service."

**Key insight:** The best metrics measure the successful delivery of value from the customer's point of view, rather than internal activity.

**Apply this by:**
- Define metrics based on the absence of friction (e.g., 'zero support tickets').
- Ensure the metric is something you would be proud to show the customer.

### From John Cutler

> "I wrote the North Star Playbook in partnership with Jason who was a co-writer with that. We did a lot of one-to-one coaching sessions. I had these things called product therapy sessions when I would just wake up in the morning and just kind of soak in whatever problem people were having for the day."

**Key insight:** North Star metrics are most effective when treated as a qualitative model that helps teams align on value before adding measurement.

**Apply this by:**
- Use the 'three games of product' framework to categorize how your North Star inputs function.

### From Julie Zhuo
*Julie Zhuo 2.0*

> "Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done."

**Key insight:** Management is fundamentally about defining a clear outcome and organizing resources to achieve it.

**Apply this by:**
- Define a clear North Star and vision for the team.
