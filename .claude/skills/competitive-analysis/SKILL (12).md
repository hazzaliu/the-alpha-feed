## Top Insights

### From April Dunford
*April Dunford*

> "the first step in a good positioning exercise is to really understand, what do we have to position against? So put another way, it's like saying, what do I have to beat in order to win a deal? So in positioning work we call this competitive alternatives."

**Key insight:** Positioning must begin by identifying the 'competitive alternatives'—what the customer would do if your product didn't exist.

**Apply this by:**
- Identify what you have to beat to win a deal
- Look beyond direct competitors to 'competitive alternatives'

### From Hamilton Helmer

> "Understanding whether or not there is a type of power in place is hard... It comes down to the hard part is industry economics is what really are the economic relationships and it's very hard."

**Key insight:** True competitive advantage is difficult to identify and requires a deep understanding of the underlying industry economics rather than surface-level observations.

**Apply this by:**
- Analyze the specific economic relationships in your industry to determine if a perceived advantage is actually a durable power.

### From Shaun Clowes
*Shaun Clowes*

> "In everything always talk from the customer's perspective, from the market's perspective, from the competitor's perspective, the very small number of PMs do that."

**Key insight:** Great product managers differentiate themselves by consistently grounding their work in external market and competitor realities rather than internal politics.

**Apply this by:**
- Start every document from the perspective of the customer, market, or competitor.

### From Bret Taylor
*Bret Taylor*

> "Why use this instead of Yahoo Yellow Pages? But more than anything else, why use this instead of the Yellow Pages?"

**Key insight:** Competitive analysis should include the 'analog' or non-consumption alternative, not just direct digital competitors.

**Apply this by:**
- Compare your product against the traditional, non-digital way users solve the problem

### From Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky
*Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky 2.0*

> "What's the competition for solving that problem? How do they solve it today? And what are the alternatives? How else do people solve this? What are the workarounds?"

**Key insight:** Competition includes not just direct competitors, but any workaround or alternative the customer currently uses to solve the problem.

**Apply this by:**
- Look beyond direct startup competitors to manual workarounds or existing habits.
- Identify how customers are currently dealing with the problem today.
