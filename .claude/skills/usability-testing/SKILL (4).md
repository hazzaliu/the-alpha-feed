## Top Insights

### From Itamar Gilad

> "Initially you fake it, you do a fake door test, you do a smoke test, Wizard of Oz tests. We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people. But it wasn't really Gmail, it was just a facade of HTML and..."

**Key insight:** Use 'faked' versions of a product (Wizard of Oz or smoke tests) to validate the core value proposition before writing production code.

**Apply this by:**
- Run 'Wizard of Oz' tests where humans manually perform the automated task behind a facade
- Use 'Fake Door' tests to measure user intent and click-through rates on non-existent features

### From Judd Antin

> "The micro level, there's so much business value to be derived there... We changed the text on the button with help from our amazing content design... We basically changed seven characters and made Airbnb millions of dollars, because what we found out was really simple. It was just like, 'Hey, this..."

**Key insight:** Micro-level evaluative research and usability testing can drive massive business value through small, tactical optimizations.

**Apply this by:**
- Don't dismiss usability testing as 'junior' work; it is high-leverage for business metrics.
- Look for 'scary' or confusing CTAs that might be blocking the conversion funnel.

### From Upasna Gautam

> "I had a big working session planned with my users to do research with them, or do user testing, and breaking news breaks, and it takes so much time and effort to gather a team of editors across the globe to do a user testing session. And when breaking news happens, they have to prioritize that over..."

**Key insight:** User testing in a high-pressure environment like news requires extreme flexibility as users will always prioritize breaking events over research sessions.

**Apply this by:**
- Build in buffers and backups for research sessions involving busy stakeholders
- Be prepared to pivot or reschedule at a moment's notice

### From Amjad Masad

> "We've seen product managers build, like I said, like a v1 of an app and actually go out and test it with users. I can't name the company, but there's a public company that have used Replit to test a v1 of an app. And obviously after that sort of works, they take it to the engineers and they're..."

**Key insight:** AI tools allow PMs to bypass engineering bottlenecks to create functional prototypes for real-world user testing.

**Apply this by:**
- Build a functional v1 independently to validate ideas with users before putting them on the official engineering roadmap.

### From Bob Baxley

> "Go observe people going through self-checkout at Target... then go watch it at some other grocery store where it's not as great and really notice what happens with people... Just go watch somebody over 70 fumble with a chip card insert or watch somebody try to figure out Apple Pay."

**Key insight:** Developing product intuition requires observing humans interacting with technology in the wild, outside of controlled lab environments.

**Apply this by:**
- Conduct 'reality checks' by watching users interact with competitor products to see their unbiased behavior and needs.
