## Top Insights

### From Ryan Singer
*Ryan Singer*

> "We’re going to go the other way around and we’re going to say, what is the maximum amount of time we’re willing to go before we actually finish something? How do we come up with a idea that’s going to work in the amount of time that the business is interested in spending?"

**Key insight:** Instead of estimating how long a feature will take, set a fixed time budget (appetite) and design a version of the solution that fits within it.

**Apply this by:**
- Set a maximum time limit (e.g., six weeks) for any project to maintain visibility and control.
- Vary the scope of the solution rather than the deadline to ensure shipping.

### From Eric Ries

> "MVP is simply for whatever the hypothesis is that we're trying to test, what is the most efficient way to get the validation we need about whether a hypothesis is true or not?"

**Key insight:** An MVP is a validation tool for a specific hypothesis, not just a low-quality version of a product.

**Apply this by:**
- Identify the core hypothesis first
- Determine the most efficient way to get validation
- Contain the liability of making a mistake

### From Jason Fried
*Jason Fried*

> "We instead have appetites. And our appetite for any individual feature is no more than six weeks. Essentially that's our budget we're willing to spend. I'm only willing to spend six weeks in any feature. So we have to figure out the simplest, most effective version of that to get that done within..."

**Key insight:** Use a fixed time budget (an 'appetite') rather than an estimate to force the team to find the simplest, most effective version of a feature.

**Apply this by:**
- Set a hard maximum of six weeks for any feature development
- Treat time as a budget to be spent rather than a deadline to be estimated
- Limit team size to two people (one designer, one programmer) to maintain focus

### From Anton Osika
*Anton Osika*

> "A lot of jargon that I like to use to emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum lovable product and then building a lovable product and then building an absolutely lovable product. So I took that jargon with me in the company name."

**Key insight:** Shift the focus from 'Minimum Viable Product' to 'Minimum Lovable Product' to ensure the initial release resonates emotionally with users.

**Apply this by:**
- Aim for 'lovability' rather than just 'viability' in early versions
- Iterate from Minimum Lovable to Absolutely Lovable

### From Crystal W
*Crystal W*

> "It's really this Wizard of Oz experience. We don't have to build anything. I coordinated with a bunch of interns and we were able to validate some of the value prop and conversion rates that we would expect in a subscription service."

**Key insight:** Use manual 'Wizard of Oz' testing to validate product value propositions before investing in engineering resources.

**Apply this by:**
- Use WhatsApp groups to manually simulate automated features
- Test onboarding flows using simple in-app message overlays on existing screens
- Use Typeform for quick feature validation like personality quizzes
