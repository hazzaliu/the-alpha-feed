## Top Insights

### From Jen Abel

> "Founder led sales is really that first milestone that a startup goes through on the commercial side, which is, how do I go out and get my first few customers? ... the founder is the product."

**Key insight:** In the early stages, the founder's novel insight and subject matter expertise are the primary drivers of interest before a brand or product is fully established.

**Apply this by:**
- Leverage the founder's status as the highest order in the hierarchy to gain market access.
- Use the founder's ability to see 'budding moments' in conversations to refine the product vision.

### From April Dunford

> "40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, 'Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better.'... the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice..."

**Key insight:** The primary competitor in B2B sales is often customer indecision and the fear of making a high-stakes mistake rather than other software vendors.

**Apply this by:**
- Focus on helping the buyer make a choice confidently rather than just pitching features.
- Act as a guide to help the buyer navigate the market and understand their options.
- Recognize that 'no decision' is the safest risk-free path for a buyer who is overwhelmed.

### From Dalton Caldwell

> "The Collison Install is what often happens with customers, is that they say, 'Yes, I want you buy your product.' And then they do not implement it, they just go quiet. There's no implementation and this is very bad if you're selling software to someone... they would just install Stripe into the..."

**Key insight:** Early sales success requires 'white glove' service to ensure the customer actually implements and uses the product after the initial 'yes.'

**Apply this by:**
- Don't consider a sale finished until the product is fully implemented
- Offer to manually install or set up the software for the customer to ensure activation
- Be persistent and available to help customers through the 'last mile' of implementation

### From Geoffrey Moore

> "Shut the God damn laptop. Just don't open it and start with... 'We're here because we've been working with some people in your industry and we understand there's this really serious problem... and we believe that your company might have it, is that true?'"

**Key insight:** Early sales to pragmatists should be diagnostic and focused entirely on the customer's pain rather than product demos.

**Apply this by:**
- Avoid opening your laptop or giving a demo in the initial diagnostic meeting.
- Ask probing questions to let the customer 'self-diagnose' their problem.

### From Pete Kazanjy

> "The point is is that you can't outsource that behavior, the founder's got to do that stuff. A lot of people ask me that question, "Well, I suck at sales," or, "I'm afraid to talk to people," or, "Interfacing with non-friendly parties makes me uncomfortable." The way to think about it is... it's..."

**Key insight:** Founders cannot outsource early sales because they need the direct feedback loop to validate the product and message.

**Apply this by:**
- Do not hire a VP of Sales until you have closed the first couple dozen customers yourself
- Use early sales calls as customer development to refine the product-market fit
- Focus on becoming 'minimally viable' at selling rather than a master
