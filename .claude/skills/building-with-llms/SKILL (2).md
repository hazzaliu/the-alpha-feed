- GPT
- Claude
- Large language model
- Prompt engineering
- AI application

## Top Insights

### From Sander Schulhoff
*Sander Schulhoff*

> "Studies have shown that using bad prompts can get you down to 0% on a problem, and good prompts can boost you up to 90%. People will always be saying, "It's dead," or, "It's going to be dead with the next model version," but then it comes out and it's not."

**Key insight:** Prompt engineering remains a critical skill for eliciting high performance from models, despite recurring claims that it will become obsolete.

**Apply this by:**
- Don't assume newer models eliminate the need for prompting skills
- Focus on 'artificial social intelligence'—understanding how to communicate effectively with AI

### From Karina Nguyen

> "Model training is more an art than a science. And in a lot of ways we, as model trainers, think a lot about data quality. It's one of the most important things in model training is like how do you ensure the highest quality data for certain interaction model behavior that you want to create? But..."

**Key insight:** Model training requires a focus on high-quality data and a debugging mindset similar to traditional software engineering.

**Apply this by:**
- Debug models by identifying where conflicting data (e.g., 'you have no body' vs 'set an alarm') causes model confusion.

### From Dan Shipper
*Dan Shipper*

> "I think people are truly sleeping on how good Claude Code is for non-coders... It has access to your file system, it knows how to use any kind of terminal command and it knows how to browse the web... You can give it something to do and it will go off and it'll run for 20 or 30 minutes and complete..."

**Key insight:** Command-line AI agents like Claude Code are highly underrated tools for non-technical users to perform complex, autonomous file processing and research tasks.

**Apply this by:**
- Use Claude Code to process large folders of meeting notes to identify subtle patterns like conflict avoidance
- Download public domain texts to have the AI analyze specific writing styles and create character description guides

### From Logan Kilpatrick
*Logan Kilpatrick*

> "I think engineering is actually one of the highest leverage things that you could be using AI to do today and really unlocking, probably on the order of at least a 50% improvement, especially for some of the lower hanging fruit software engineering tasks."

**Key insight:** AI provides the highest immediate ROI in software engineering by automating routine tasks.

**Apply this by:**
- Use LLMs to handle 'lower hanging fruit' coding tasks to achieve up to 50% efficiency gains.
- Leverage tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to accelerate shipping cycles.

### From Bret Taylor
*Bret Taylor*

> "I think the act of creating software is going to transform from typing into a terminal... to operating a code-generating machine."

**Key insight:** Coding is shifting from manual syntax writing to the high-level operation and supervision of AI systems.

**Apply this by:**
- Focus on systems thinking and architectural constraints rather than rote syntax
