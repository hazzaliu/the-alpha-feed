## Top Insights

### From Elena Verna

> "I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here because we just need to invest in such bigger bets, and innovate, and create new growth loops here, everybody and their mother is starting a vibe coding business nowadays, and we need to..."

**Key insight:** In fast-moving AI categories, growth requires constant innovation of new loops rather than incremental optimization of existing ones.

**Apply this by:**
- Shift focus from 95% optimization to 95% innovation in growth strategies.
- Invest in 'bigger bets' that reinvent the solution rather than tweaking the current journey.

> "With certainty, if you're good at your job, you can make an app grow and go viral. Over the years of building all these apps, I've accrued all these growth hacks that still nobody knows about."

**Key insight:** Viral growth is a repeatable science that can be mastered through specific tactical mechanisms.

**Apply this by:**
- Develop a library of growth hacks based on platform-specific mechanisms

### From Yuriy Timen

> "If you have really healthy LTVs... then there is a big opportunity to play paid and lean into paid growth loops and paid acquisition loops."

**Key insight:** High customer lifetime value (LTV) is the primary prerequisite for scaling paid acquisition loops.

**Apply this by:**
- Calculate if single-player LTVs are high enough (e.g., hundreds of dollars) to support paid loops.

### From Adam Grenier

> "The exploring emerging channels framework that I'll take... has three core ingredients... understanding if there is an overlap between what the customers need is, what your company's goals are, and what the channel actually does really well."

**Key insight:** Successful acquisition channel selection requires a three-way fit between customer needs, business goals, and the inherent strengths of the medium.

**Apply this by:**
- Evaluate if the channel's medium (e.g., audio, video) matches your product's storytelling needs
- Prioritize channels where the 'strength of the medium' aligns with your growth goals

### From Ben Williams
*Ben Williams*

> "Being able to identify the various micro and macro loops, how they're all connected, being able to document them in a qualitative model to communicate a shared understanding of how you grow, it's really powerful."

**Key insight:** Mapping growth through qualitative and quantitative loop models provides a shared understanding and guides intentional investment.

**Apply this by:**
- Document micro and macro loops in a qualitative model
- Augment qualitative models with quantitative data to guide quarterly focus
