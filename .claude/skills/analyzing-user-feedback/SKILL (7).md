## Top Insights

### From Marty Cagan

> "When we're doing user research, we're finding all the reasons they don't like it. In fact, that's an Elon Musk quote is when you do user a research, you should be focused on finding all the reasons they won't use your product."

**Key insight:** The primary goal of evaluative research is to identify friction and reasons for rejection rather than seeking validation.

**Apply this by:**
- Focus user research on finding reasons why a customer would NOT use the product
- Use evaluative research to uncover flaws in the solution

### From Christine Itwaru

> "The synthesis of both this qualitative and quantitative data as a theme that I saw arising across our customer base... bringing all of these different inputs that would traditionally be handled by product manager... to the surface when they're going through their product development lifecycle..."

**Key insight:** Product operations centralizes and synthesizes diverse feedback sources to provide PMs with actionable insights during planning cycles.

**Apply this by:**
- Aggregate qualitative feedback from sales and success with quantitative usage data
- Surface synthesized feedback themes specifically during the product development lifecycle planning phase

### From Claire Butler
*Claire Butler*

> "We implemented Intercom back in the early days... Dylan would jump in, an engineer would jump in. And he'd open up a chat with people and they'd actually debug the product with us live. They'd be like, "I have this bug," and this engineer would be like, "Let me QA it right now.""

**Key insight:** Direct, real-time interaction between engineers and users in the early days builds intense loyalty and ensures rapid bug resolution.

**Apply this by:**
- Have the entire team, including engineers and founders, participate in early customer support
- Debug issues live with users to demonstrate extreme care and responsiveness

### From Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar

> "The first step in conquering data like this is just to write notes... You sample your data and just take a look, and it's surprising how much you learn when you do this."

**Key insight:** Manual 'trace analysis' (reviewing logs) is the most effective way to understand how an AI product is actually performing.

**Apply this by:**
- Sample production traces and manually annotate them
- Perform 'open coding' by writing down the first thing seen that is wrong

### From Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles
*Melissa Perri + Denise Tilles*

> "It's also about aggregating all the interviews or customer research that's been done so people can query it and start to see what do we already know so we're not going out there and duplicating a bunch of research."

**Key insight:** Centralizing research findings into a queryable database prevents redundant discovery work across the organization.

**Apply this by:**
- Use tools like Dovetail to aggregate qualitative research
- Create a 'findings database' that allows team members to query past interview results
