## Top Insights

### From Will Larson
*Will Larson*

> "The first rule of strategy is that if you write it down, then you can improve it. If it's not written down, it's hard to say if this PM is just not a good PM or if they're trying to apply the strategy that they've misunderstood... If you have a written document, even if it's not a super compelling..."

**Key insight:** A written strategy is essential for organizational alignment and provides a baseline that can be critiqued and improved.

**Apply this by:**
- Document the strategy even if it is imperfect to allow for 'debugging' and alignment
- Use the Richard Rumelt framework: Diagnosis, Guiding Policies, and Actions
