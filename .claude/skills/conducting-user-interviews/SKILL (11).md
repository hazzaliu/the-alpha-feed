## Top Insights

### From Jeff Weinstein

> "The moment the customer felt compelled enough to go out of their way to talk about some problem, that's a unbelievable gift. I will leave a meeting to just get one message back to them. If you're text message friendly with five or 10 of those, you are going to have so much direct signal that is..."

**Key insight:** Direct, high-speed communication with a small group of highly engaged customers provides more valuable signal than large-scale aggregate data.

**Apply this by:**
- Respond to customer feedback with extreme speed to build a 'secret portal' of trust.
- Aim to be 'text message friendly' with 5-10 ambitious, technical customers.

### From Bob Moesta

> "The first thing we do is we try to extract the story from the customer. And it doesn't have to be my product, it could be somebody else's product if I haven't built it yet. It's like, what are people going to fire when they hire me?"

**Key insight:** Interviews should focus on the 'story' of why a user switched from an old solution to a new one.

**Apply this by:**
- Interview people who have recently purchased or switched products to understand the 'causation' of their move.
- Ask about what the user will 'fire' in order to 'hire' your new product.

### From Gustaf Alstromer

> "The problem is, which anyone who hasn't done sales before that joined YC, they realize this, is that if you take the average customer group in the world, 90% are not early adopters... Those 10 percents are the early adopters. They're The ones that you actually want to reach. But that means you have..."

**Key insight:** Finding the right users to interview requires high-volume outreach to filter for the 10% who are early adopters.

**Apply this by:**
- Expect a 90% rejection or indifference rate when seeking discovery interviews
- Target the 10% of users who are willing to take risks on new solutions

### From Marty Cagan

> "I tell this to user researchers at the companies that I coach, if the product manager and the designer are not available to be there during their products test, cancel the test. They need to be there. This is what makes them useful to their team."

**Key insight:** Direct observation of user testing is essential for PMs and designers; delegated research reports are insufficient.

**Apply this by:**
- Ensure the PM and Designer are present for every user test
- Avoid relying on research reports delivered in isolation by researchers

### From Teresa Torres
*Teresa Torres*

> "I think interviewing is a grossly underestimated skill. Grossly underestimated skill. So that's the first thing is that if you're not collecting rich stories in your interviews, it's going to be really hard to identify opportunities."

**Key insight:** The primary goal of a user interview is to collect specific stories rather than general facts or opinions.

**Apply this by:**
- Avoid asking direct questions out of context (e.g., 'What do you like to watch?')
- Ask for specific instances (e.g., 'Tell me about the last time you watched a movie')
- Ground the interview in behavior to get reliable data
