## Top Insights

### From Ramesh Johari
*Ramesh Johari*

> "Experimentation was never historically in science about winners and losers... Experimentation is always very hypothesis driven. It's about, what are you learning? And that's really an important distinction because what it means is if I go with something big, risky, and it, 'fails,' meaning that..."

**Key insight:** A healthy experimentation culture values learning from 'failed' risky bets more than safe, incremental 'wins.'

**Apply this by:**
- Define clear hypotheses for every experiment so that a 'loss' still provides actionable business intelligence.
- Avoid judging data scientists solely on the number of 'wins' per quarter to prevent risk-aversion.

### From Alex Hardimen

> "I think about wartime product management, right? You're coming in, and I think there was... this incredible humility that was needed to really understand and first diagnose what was actually happening on the platform."

**Key insight:** Managing through a crisis requires 'wartime' humility to accurately diagnose problems before attempting solutions.

**Apply this by:**
- Prioritize diagnosis over immediate action in a crisis
- Approach unknown platform issues with humility

### From Nikita Bier
*Nikita Bier*

> "Develop a reproducible testing process, and that will actually influence the probability of your success more than anything. It's so unpredictable whether a consumer product idea will work."

**Key insight:** Success in consumer products is driven by the quality and speed of the testing process rather than the initial idea.

**Apply this by:**
- Build a system for taking 'many shots at bat' to reduce the risk of unpredictability

### From Shaun Clowes
*Shaun Clowes*

> "Data is more like a compass than a GPS. If you look at data as a way of giving you the answer, you're always wrong. You're always wrong or you're slow. Wrong or slow or sometimes both, because mostly data doesn't give you the answer. It just tells you if what you just said is ridiculous or there's..."

**Key insight:** Data should be used to validate or invalidate intuition rather than as a definitive roadmap for decision-making.

**Apply this by:**
- Use data to disprove your assumptions rather than waiting for it to tell you exactly what to do.

### From Upasna Gautam
*Upasna Gautam*

> "We always have to have the ability to A, pivot of course, but also have backup and buffers in those types of scenarios. So any time we're planning we build in buffers for all of that chaos that's happening on a daily basis."

**Key insight:** In chaotic environments, planning must include explicit time buffers and contingency plans to remain effective.

**Apply this by:**
- Build buffers into project timelines ranging from days to months depending on scope
- Assess situations objectively daily to decide whether to use buffers or move to the next phase
