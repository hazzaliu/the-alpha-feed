### From Benjamin Lauzier

> "If you don't have product market fit, and if you don't have a good enough growth strategy for at least one side of your marketplace, just forget about all this marketplace stuff. Focus on this core exchange of value, go deep with one side of the marketplace and see if you can rely on some crutch,..."

**Key insight:** Pre-product-market fit marketplaces should ignore complex marketplace dynamics and focus entirely on the core exchange of value and a growth strategy for one side.

**Apply this by:**
- Focus on the 'hardest side' of the marketplace first (usually supply).
- Use hacks or 'crutches' (like Craigslist) to jumpstart the easier side while proving the core value proposition.

### From Sean Ellis

> "The question is, how would you feel if you could no longer use this product? And I give them the choice, very disappointed, somewhat disappointed, or even not disappointed or not applicable, I've already stopped using the product. And what I'm trying to find are those people who say, 'I would be..."

**Key insight:** The 'Sean Ellis Test' identifies 'must-have' status as a leading indicator of product-market fit.

**Apply this by:**
- Ask users how they would feel if they could no longer use the product.
- Focus on the 'very disappointed' segment as your core value indicator.

### From Adam Grenier

> "One of the biggest pieces of advice I'm giving to people that are like, "How should we adjust our marketing with the economic changes and things like that?" I was like, "Start by assuming you no longer have product market fit, because you had product market fit in a different market." It's a..."

**Key insight:** Product-market fit is not static; changes in the external economic environment can effectively reset your PMF even if the product remains the same.

**Apply this by:**
- Assume you no longer have PMF when the market shifts significantly
- Re-evaluate your customer base rather than just looking for new acquisition channels

### From Casey Winters

> "Protecting what you've built actually is increasingly important once you build scale... if you're not continually pushing to make your product better... you're eventually not necessarily tomorrow, but maybe in a year, maybe in five years, you might find yourself fall out of product market fit..."

**Key insight:** Product-market fit is a moving target that can be lost if a company fails to keep pace with rising user expectations and competitive improvements.

**Apply this by:**
- Frame technical maintenance as 'protecting the gains' to justify investment to leadership
- Continuously iterate on the core product to prevent falling behind the market's evolving baseline

### From Christian Idiodi
*Christian Idiodi*

> "The holy grail of product walk is really a reference customer. This is somebody that has used your solution or your product, loves it enough to tell people about it... I want six to eight references, for B2C, I want maybe 15 to 25 references as an indication that we've achieved product market fit."

**Key insight:** Product-market fit is validated when a specific threshold of customers is willing to put their reputation on the line as a reference for your product.

**Apply this by:**
- Target 6-8 reference customers for B2B products.
- Target 15-25 reference customers for B2C products.
- Do not launch publicly until you have secured the target number of 5-star references from early users.
