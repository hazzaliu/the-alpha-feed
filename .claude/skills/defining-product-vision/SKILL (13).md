## Top Insights

### From Melissa Perri

> "I once asked all the executive team at a healthcare company, what's the vision for this company? And they said, to be the backbone of healthcare. And I said, what does that mean? And they couldn't elaborate. Nobody could elaborate on that. And I said, cool, that's a tagline, but it's not a vision."

**Key insight:** A vision is not a marketing tagline; it must be a concrete description of what the company will manifest into over the next five to ten years.

**Apply this by:**
- Ask leaders to elaborate on vague vision statements to see if they have a shared understanding of the future state.
- Define who the future customers will be and how the value provided will differ from today.

> "four things. So it has to be lofty, it has to be realistic, it has to be devoid of any tech or limitations of today, and it has to be grounded in a very clear and potent problem. User problem."

**Key insight:** A strong product vision must balance being aspirational with being attainable, while ignoring current technical constraints to focus on the core user problem.

**Apply this by:**
- Ensure the vision is lofty enough to be exciting but realistic enough to feel reachable
- Remove technical limitations of today when imagining the future state
- Ground the vision in a potent user problem

> "At the most basic level, I would say that our product is our journalism, which we then marry with a really compelling and useful user experience, in a way that helps people really act on our journalism so that they can understand and engage with the world around them."

**Key insight:** Product vision in media should center on the core content (journalism) enhanced by a user experience that drives real-world engagement.

**Apply this by:**
- Marry core content with compelling UX
- Focus on helping users 'act' on the information provided

### From Chandra Janakiraman

> "Product strategy sits between the mission and vision and the plan... It forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact."

**Key insight:** Strategy acts as the connective tissue between high-level purpose and tactical execution by mandating specific choices.

**Apply this by:**
- Position strategy between the mission/vision and the roadmap
- Focus on achieving 'resonance' between the product and the market

### From Ivan Zhao

> "Our realization is actually let's hide our vision, which is everybody can create their software in the form factor that people do care. So what kind of tool do people use every day? Productivity software. It took us two years to realize we need to build a productivity tool. We called it..."

**Key insight:** Successful products often package a radical long-term vision inside a familiar, high-utility form factor that users already understand and need.

**Apply this by:**
- Identify the 'sugar' (the immediate utility users want) to deliver the 'broccoli' (your deeper vision/technology).
- Avoid building purely for your own values if it results in a product that the mass market doesn't care about.
