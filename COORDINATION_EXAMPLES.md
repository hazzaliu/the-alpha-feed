# 👑 Coordination Examples — How to Lead Your Court

## The System

**You (King)** → Give high-level tasks to Lady Philippa
**Lady Philippa** → Coordinates other courtiers, reports back
**Other Courtiers** → Execute their expertise
**Result** → You just lead, Philippa handles execution

```
Your Majesty, okay bet landing page - let me coordinate the court on this 📋

Courtiers, His Majesty needs a landing page. Here's what I need:

Genny: Design a clean, conversion-optimized layout. Hero section, features, CTA. Mobile-first.

Seb: Build with Next.js, deploy to Vercel. Fast load times, responsive, clean code.

### Courtiers Respond in Thread:

**Lady Genevieve:**
> "Your Majesty, okay so for the landing page UX here's what I'm thinking:
> 
> STRUCTURE:
> 1. Hero (headline + subheadline + CTA button)
> 2. Features (3-4 key features with icons)
> 3. Social proof (testimonials if you have them)
> 4. Final CTA
> 
> LAYOUT: Clean, minimal, lots of white space. Mobile-first design. One-column on mobile, two-column on desktop.
> 
> This structure converts fr fr. Users see value immediately, no scrolling required. Slay ✨"

**Lord Sebastian:**
> "yo Your Majesty, okay so I'm building this with:
> - Next.js 14 (App Router)
> - Tailwind CSS (fast styling)
> - Vercel deployment (automatic, fast)
> - Responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop
> 
> I'll have the code ready in 2 days. Genny's design is clean, this gonna be smooth to build. We're so back 💻"

**Lady Arabella:**
> "Your Majesty, okay so for copy I'm thinking:
> 
> HEADLINE: 'Finally, a todo app that doesn't overwhelm you'
> SUBHEADLINE: 'Simple, fast, and actually helps you get things done'
> 
> FEATURES:
> - Clean interface (no clutter, just your tasks)

## Example 2: Create a Pricing Strategy

### You Say:
```
@Lady Philippa help me figure out pricing for my SaaS
```

### Philippa Coordinates:

```
Your Majesty, okay bet pricing strategy - let me bring in the experts 📋

COURTIER ASSIGNMENTS:
- @Lady Beatrice - Run the numbers, analyze unit economics
- @Lady Arabella - Market positioning, competitive pricing
- @Lord Alistair - Long-term strategic implications

I'll synthesize their recommendations into a final pricing strategy fr fr 💰

@Lady Beatrice @Lady Arabella @Lord Alistair

His Majesty needs a pricing strategy. Here's what I need:

Bea: What should we charge based on costs, margins, and unit economics?

Bella: What are competitors charging? How should we position (budget vs premium)?

Ali: Long-term implications - how does pricing affect growth, market positioning, scalability?

Let's go courtiers 👑
```

### Courtiers Respond → Philippa Synthesizes → You Get Final Report

## Example 3: Quick Question (No Coordination Needed)

### You Say:
```
@Lord Sebastian should I use React or Vue?
```

### Sebastian Responds Directly:
```
yo Your Majesty! React lowkey goes way harder fr fr. The ecosystem is bussin, community is huge, jobs are plentiful. Vue is cool but React is the move if you want maximum flexibility and tooling. Your Majesty ate with this question, slay 💻
```

**No coordination needed** — simple question, direct answer.

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Lady Philippa (Coordination):
- **Building things**: "build a landing page", "create a feature", "design a system"
- **Complex tasks**: Need multiple courtiers' expertise
- **You want delegation**: Give high-level goal, she handles details
- **You want synthesis**: Multiple perspectives combined into one report

### Use !summon (Debate):
- **Decisions**: "should we do X or Y?"
- **Strategy discussions**: "what's our go-to-market?"
- **Tradeoff analysis**: Multiple valid options, need discussion

### Use Direct @mention (Quick):
- **Simple questions**: "what database should I use?"
- **Domain-specific**: You know exactly which courtier you need
- **Fast answers**: No coordination required

---

## The Workflow in Practice

### Your Role (King):
1. Give high-level tasks to Philippa
2. Approve her plans ("proceed")
3. Review final reports
4. Make decisions
5. Give next task

### Philippa's Role (Grand Vizier):
1. Breaks down your tasks
2. Assigns courtiers
3. Coordinates their work
4. Synthesizes results
5. Reports back to you

### Other Courtiers' Roles:
1. Execute their domain expertise
2. Report to Philippa (or directly to you if @mentioned)
3. Collaborate when needed

## Try It Now

Once Railway deploys, test the coordination system:

```
@Lady Philippa I want to launch my product on Product Hunt next week
```

She'll:
1. Break down the launch tasks
2. Assign courtiers (Arabella for strategy, Sebastian for tech prep, Genevieve for UX polish, Edmund for competitive intel)
3. Coordinate their work
4. Report back with a complete launch plan

You just lead. She executes. 👑
